### Hi, I'm [Oleg](https://keyoxide.org/hkp/12E87E3B10361CD9D18C279C150BCCE50E7D2580) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a back-end software engineer and system programmer working mainly with C++, Go and Python (and recently Rust).

You can take a look at [my CV](https://github.com/oevseev/oevseev/raw/65c8f89d424e50429fc934bda116c8cfc3246486/cv.pdf).

### My other somewhat IT-related interests that find reflection in my hobby projects:

- ðŸŽ› Music production
- ðŸ’¡ Electronic engineering
- â™Ÿ Mind sports and board games
- ðŸ‘¾ Video game development
- ðŸ’¾ Retrocomputing and emulation
- ðŸ“ˆ Machine learning
- and probably more
