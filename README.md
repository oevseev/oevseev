### Hi, I'm Oleg 👋

I'm a back-end software engineer and system programmer working mainly with C++, Go and Python (and recently Rust).

You can take a look at [my CV](https://github.com/oevseev/oevseev/raw/65c8f89d424e50429fc934bda116c8cfc3246486/cv.pdf).

### My other somewhat IT-related interests that find reflection in my hobby projects:

- 🎛 Music production
- 💡 Electronic engineering
- ♟ Mind sports and board games
- 👾 Video game development
- 💾 Retrocomputing and emulation
- 📈 Machine learning
- and probably more
