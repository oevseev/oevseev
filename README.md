### Hi, I'm [Oleg](https://keyoxide.org/hkp/12E87E3B10361CD9D18C279C150BCCE50E7D2580) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a back-end software engineer and system programmer working mainly with C++, Go and Python (and recently Rust).

You can take a look at [my CV](https://github.com/oevseev/oevseev/raw/master/cv.pdf). Some of my projects are hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/oevseev) as well.

### My other somewhat IT-related interests that find reflection in my hobby projects:

- ðŸŽ› Music production
- ðŸ’¡ Electronic engineering
- â™Ÿ Mind sports and board games
- ðŸ‘¾ Video games
- ðŸ’¾ Retrocomputing and emulation
- ðŸ“ˆ Data science
- and probably more
